# Getting Started

#### This project was created based on the [React-template](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

## Source data

#### The design of the project presented in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/zun1oP6NmS2Lmgbcj6e1IG/Test?type=design&node-id=0-1).

## Project information

#### The page shows cards with users which were generated from [backend](https://mockapi.io/projects). Presented activity on the page: if you would like to follow the user, you can click on FOLLOW button. If you need to recall which of the users you are subscribed to and which are not, reload the page once again in your browser. All data about your subscribtions is stored and will be immediately displayed on the page.

### Dynamics

#### When following or unfollowing the user, the button color and the text inside of it change. To implement the interactivity of the user with the app, Redux state manager was used. For better experience, user can filter the users by: 'All', 'Followed' and 'Unfollowed'. The pagination was used for better website performance.

## In conclusion...

#### This small test task was a great way to strengthen my knowledge in React and Redux. And was great expirience.
